# Genuary 2025

My take on this fantastic initiative. I prefer not to follow it day by day but rather keep it enjoyable and progress at my own pace.

## Development

### Local deploy

- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- Tweak [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) to get your desired render
- Run `npm run start` to run the app

### Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can always run `npm run lint` to make sure you follow all styling and lint rules.

Use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix all the issues found in your project.
